    "The librarian never did come, but Utagu and I decided between ourselves that it would be fine to take the books anyway."
    "We'd just let staff know we checked them out whenever we saw them next."
    "It's not a big deal. Probably."


    "The next day, we're back in class with Oni and Kokoro, whittling away the time with idle talk."
    "I watch the clock tick by and drum my fingers on my desk, utterly bored."
    "It never feels like we do anything in class. Doesn't that defeat the purpose of school?"
    "I'm here to learn things, but I don't feel like I have been."
    "I feel like we do the same nothing every day. Over and over again."
    "The same sleepy mornings and lazy afternoons spent aimlessly in this classroom between the four of us."
    "It's pointless."
    "Whatever our curriculum is, it clearly needs fixing if all I'm doing is musing here with a sense of deja vu day after day."
    "My eyes drift over to Kokoro, who's talking animatedly at Oni. The latter is looking back at her with a sort of subdued, fond expression. It's sweet."

    show oni frown
    oni "I wouldn't be surprised if that's why you're having trouble remembering it."

    show utagu worry
    utagu "How long ago was this?"
    oni "It must have been last week. I don't remember the exact day, but you showed up late to class with that bandage and we heard the story from someone who saw you fall."

    utagu "Oh…"
    kura "Who was it who saw her fall?"

    oni "Why are you interrogating me, anyway? I'm just explaining what happened."
    oni "Who cares who saw Utagu fall. She fell, and that's why she's hurt."
    oni "And she hit her head, which is why she can't remember."
    "Oni spits those last few sentences with an irritated edge, her brow furrowed in frustration."
    "She turns to her notebook and starts to doodle, clearly done with our conversation."

    kokoro "You're worrying too much."
    kokoro "I'm sure Utagu will be fine. It sounds like a nasty fall, but with bandages like those it can't be too serious."

    kokoro "It will be okay."

    utagu "Yeah…"
    "And with that, we fall silent."

    show utagu huh
    "Kokoro opens up one of her books, and Utagu looks out the window, obviously daydreaming."
    "But as I mull over what Oni said, I can't shake the sense that something isn't right."
    "She was right. I was interrogating her, because the pieces weren't fitting together."
    "If Utagu fell on her head, that would explain why she can't remember."
    "But why can't I remember, either?"
    "Surely I'd have heard about this through the grapevine. Utagu's my friend. I'd have asked about the bandaged before."
    "But here I am, with no recollection of the sort. It's as if I'd only just learnt of her bandages today, even though Oni says they've been around for at least a week."
    "And I've never heard of this Mei person, who allegedly saw Utagu fall."
    "Her description doesn't ring any bells, either."
    "I don't want to think that Oni's lying, but I just can't get myself to buy the story."
    "Since when did Utagu even have a bike?"
    "I scratch my head and catch Oni looking at me out of the corner of her eye."
    "I offer her a weak smile and turn to my notebook, mind racing more than I would like."
