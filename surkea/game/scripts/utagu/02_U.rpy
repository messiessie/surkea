    "I'm in more of a studious mood right now, I think."
    "The quiet of the library, the crisp aroma of paper, the ruffle of a page turning."
    "Yeah. I think I need some of that."
    "Utagu is good company, too, if she's in the mood to talk. Or even if she's not, really. I'd just like not to be alone."

    #<scene bg corridor>

    "I set off down the empty hall the same way Utagu just went. It's almost disconcertingly deserted, but I push the silence to the back of my mind as I round a corner and head upstairs."
    "Nobody here, either. It must just be a slow day."
    "The bright glow of the sun lights up the corridor while I walk, the heat haze outside making wave-like patterns on the floor."
    "It's like endless puddles beneath my feet."
    "The lines give an illusion of movement, as though the ground is welling up around me."
    "It's a pretty picture, and keeps me occupied as I walk."
    "In a minute I'm at the library door, and push it open with a little effort."
    "It's heavy, but it opens without a sound."

    #<scene bg library>

    "The library, too, is empty. There isn't even a librarian at the front desk. They must be out to lunch or something."
    "A wall clock ticks the seconds idly by while I scan the room for Utagu."
    "I hear the sound of a page being turned from somewhere between the shelves. I bet she's back there, relaxing on one of the brightly colored bean bag chairs. It's her favorite spot."
    "I squeeze in between the Mystery and Romance shelves, nearly tripping on a stack of detective books on the ground."

    #>UTAGU IN, Utagu_Smile.png, center

    "Coming out the other side, I spot Utagu right where I expected her, half-swallowed into a purple bean bag chair in the corner."
    "She's absorbed in a thick volume of what appears to be a fantasy novel, but her eyes flit up to look at me as I enter her field of view."

    utagu uhh "Hey, Kura."

    utagu huh "Just hanging out?"
    kura "Yeah. I figured I could use a good book right now."

    "She nods to a pile of books by her feet. It looks like a collection of fantasy and science fiction, like the book she's reading."

    utagu smile "Try one of these, maybe."
    utagu uuh "I just grabbed them, they're all on my reading list and I thought I'd take a look."
    kura smile "Oh, okay, sure."
    "I drop into the green chair at her side and pull the stack toward me, reading the spines."
    "There's some classic high fantasy, a couple space operas, some magical cyberpunk."
    "I take one that looks like modern Lord of the Rings, and another with an eye-catching robot on the cover."
    kura "You're into some cool stuff, Utagu."

    utagu smile

    "She giggles into her book."

    utagu "Thanks."
    utagu uhh "I grew up on a lot of second-hand classic sci-fi and fantasy my parents gave me, so it sort of just happened."

    utagu huh "It's weird, though."
    kura hmm "Hm?"
    utagu "Something about this book is really familiar."
    utagu "I know I haven't read it, but it feels like I've read a similar book in the past."

    utagu frown "I can't place it, though."
    utagu "The plot and characters just read as familiar."
    kura "Huh."
    kura "There are only so many stories, I guess. It's inevitable you'll run into similar ones now and again."

    utagu worry "Yeah…"
    utagu "Deja vu, I guess."
    "She stares off with a worried expression. It's a look I know well."
    "Utagu's anxiety has a tendency to spiral when unchecked."
    "I've spent enough time with her to know that she needs a distraction whenever it happens."
    "I grab the robot book and hold it up for her to see."
    kura smile "Okay, what about this one, though?"
    kura "What do you know about it?"
    "My words bring her back to the present and she blinks, looking at the cover."

    utagu smile

    "Her face opens into a smile."
    utagu "Oh, that one!"

    utagu uhh "I'm excited to get to it, actually."
    utagu "The author's written a lot of great robot and android stories. It's like, her specialty."

    utagu huh "She has so many books, though, it's hard to find them all."
    utagu "That's one I've been looking for for a while now, I was happy to find it."

    utagu smile "You'd probably like it, too. It's got the right blend of thriller and fun."
    kura hmm "Oh? That sounds like a good read."
    utagu "It definitely will be. Give it a look."
    kura smile "For sure. But what about this-"
    kura hmm
    "I pause, confused."
    "I was about to show Utagu the other book I'd taken from her stack. The Lord-of-the-Rings-looking one I'd set on my lap along with the robot book."
    "But it's not there."
    "It's just the robot book in my hand, and nothing else."

    utagu frown "Kura? You okay?"
    kura "Yeah, I just…"
    "I bend over and take a look at Utagu's stack."
    "The book is right where I'd spotted it, unmoved between all the other volumes."
    "I could swear I grabbed it. But there it is, like I never touched it."
    "I blink a few times and rub my eyes."

    utagu huh "What's wrong?"
    "Yep. It's definitely still there, and not in my lap."
    "I'm probably just tired from a late night. The brain fog isn't helping my absent-mindedness."
    kura smile "Nothing. I thought I took one of these other books, but I must be misremembering, because it's still there."
    "She looks between me and the stack."

    utagu uhh "Oh."
    utagu "That's a little weird."

    utagu worry "I wonder how that could happen…"
    kura "Like I said, I'm sure it's nothing. I make mistakes like that all the time."

    utagu frown "Do you?"
    "She's eyeing me with a look. I know that look. The 'something's terribly wrong' look Utagu has when her anxieties get the better of her."
    kura smile "Totally."
    kura "Half the time I don't even pack the right books for class."
    kura "I'm just tired. Imagining things."
    "Utagu's still squinting at me, but the suspicion in her face softens somewhat."

    utagu uhh "Alright, Kura. If you say so…"
    kura "Yeah."
    kura "Anyway, I should let you get back to your book."

    utagu huh "Oh, this?"
    utagu "I wasn't actually going to read it right now. I'm just deciding which books I want to take out. We're only allowed five, remember?"
    kura "Oh yeah."

    utagu smile "So I need to prioritize."
    utagu uhh "I do think I'll take this one, though."
    kura "You might need to wait a bit."

    utagu huh "What do you mean?"
    kura "Well, when I came in there was nobody at the front desk, so we can't really check anything out of the library until they're back."

    utagu frown "Right… I didn't see anybody when I came in, either. That's annoying."
    utagu "I wonder where they all are…"
    kura "We did just come from lunch, so I thought maybe they're all still on their lunch breaks."

    utagu worry "Yeah. Maybe."
    kura "Don't worry, I'll wait with you in the meantime."
    kura "In fact, whichever of these you decide not to take, I'll check out myself."

    utagu smile
    "Utagu laughs and leans back into her chair, burying her face another book from the stack."
    utagu "Perfect."
    "I flip open the robot book, find the first sentence, and start reading."
