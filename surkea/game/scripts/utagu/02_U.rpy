    "I'm in more of a studious mood right now, I think."
    "The quiet of the library, the crisp aroma of paper, the ruffle of a page turning."
    "Yeah. I think I need some of that."
    "Utagu is good company, too, if she's in the mood to talk. Or even if she's not, really. I'd just like not to be alone."

    "I set off down the empty hall the same way Utagu just went. It's almost disconcertingly deserted, but I push the silence to the back of my mind as I round a corner and head upstairs."
    "Nobody here, either. It must just be a slow day."
    "The bright glow of the sun lights up the corridor while I walk, the heat haze outside making wave-like patterns on the floor."
    "It's like endless puddles beneath my feet."
    "The lines give an illusion of movement, as though the ground is welling up around me."
    "It's a pretty picture, and keeps me occupied as I walk."
    "In a minute I'm at the library door. Only Utagu's sitting on the floor outside it."
    "She's absorbed in a thick volume of what appears to be a fantasy novel, but her eyes flit up to look at me as I enter her field of view."

    show utagu uuh 
    utagu "Hey, Kura."
    kura "What are you doing out here?"

    show utagu huh 
    utagu "Oh, there's nobody in the library and I didn't like the feeling of being alone in there. This is better."
    kura "Really?"
    "I push open the library door to peek inside for a moment."
    "Sure enough, it's completely deserted. There's not even anyone at the front desk."
    kura "Huh. That's strange."
    utagu "It is."
    
    show utagu uuh
    "She nods to a pile of books by her feet.  It looks like a collection of fantasy and science fiction, like the book she's reading."
    utagu "Try one of these, maybe."
    utagu "I just grabbed them, they're all on my reading list and I thought I'd take a look."
    show kura hmm
    kura "Oh, okay, sure."
    "I slide down to the ground beside her and pull the stack toward me, reading the spines."
    "There's some classic high fantasy, a couple space operas, some magical cyberpunk."
    "I take one that looks like modern Lord of the Rings, and another with an eye-catching robot on the cover."
    
    show kura smile
    
    kura "You're into some cool stuff, Utagu."

    show utagu smile

    "She giggles into her book."

    show utagu uuh

    utagu "Thanks."
    utagu "I grew up on a lot of second-hand classic sci-fi and fantasy my parents gave me, so it sort of just happened."

    show utagu huh 
    utagu "It's weird, though."
    show kura hmm 
    kura "Hm?"
    utagu "Something about this book is really familiar."
    utagu "I know I haven't read it, but it feels like I've read a similar book in the past."

    show utagu frown 
    utagu "I can't place it, though."
    utagu "The plot and characters just read as familiar."
    show kura hmm
    kura "Huh."
    kura "There are only so many stories, I guess. It's inevitable you'll run into similar ones now and again."

    show utagu worry 
    utagu "Yeah…"
    utagu "Deja vu, I guess."
    "She stares off with a worried expression. It's a look I know well."
    "Utagu's anxiety has a tendency to spiral when unchecked."
    "I've spent enough time with her to know that she needs a distraction whenever it happens."
    "I grab the robot book and hold it up for her to see."
    kura smile "Okay, what about this one, though?"
    kura "What do you know about it?"
    "My words bring her back to the present and she blinks, looking at the cover."

    show utagu smile

    "Her face opens into a smile."
    utagu "Oh, that one!"

    show utagu uuh 
    utagu "I'm excited to get to it, actually."
    utagu "The author's written a lot of great robot and android stories. It's like, her specialty."

    show utagu huh 
    utagu "She has so many books, though, it's hard to find them all."
    utagu "That's one I've been looking for for a while now, I was happy to find it."

    show utagu smile 
    utagu "You'd probably like it, too. It's got the right blend of thriller and fun."
    show kura hmm 
    kura "Oh? That sounds like a good read."
    utagu "It definitely will be. Give it a look."
    kura "For sure. But what about this-"
    show kura hmm
    "I pause, confused."
    "I was about to show Utagu the other book I'd taken from her stack. The Lord-of-the-Rings-looking one I'd set on my lap along with the robot book."
    "But it's not there."
    "It's just the robot book in my hand, and nothing else."

    show utagu frown 
    utagu "Kura? You okay?"
    show kura frown
    kura "Yeah, I just…"
    "I bend over and take a look at Utagu's stack."
    "The book is right where I'd spotted it, unmoved between all the other volumes."
    "I could swear I grabbed it. But there it is, like I never touched it."
    "I blink a few times and rub my eyes."

    show utagu huh 
    utagu "What's wrong?"
    "Yep. It's definitely still there, and not in my lap."
    "I'm probably just tired from a late night. The brain fog isn't helping my absent-mindedness."
    show kura hmm 
    kura "Nothing. I thought I took one of these other books, but I must be misremembering, because it's still there."
    "She looks between me and the stack."

    show utagu uuh 
    utagu "Oh."
    utagu "That's a little weird."

    show utagu worry 
    utagu "I wonder how that could happen…"
    kura "Like I said, I'm sure it's nothing. I make mistakes like that all the time."

    show utagu frown 
    utagu "Do you?"
    "She's eyeing me with a look. I know that look. The 'something's terribly wrong' look Utagu has when her anxieties get the better of her."
    show kura smile 
    kura "Totally."
    kura "Half the time I don't even pack the right books for class."
    kura "I'm just tired. Imagining things."
    "Utagu's still squinting at me, but the suspicion in her face softens somewhat."

    show utagu uuh 
    utagu "Alright, Kura. If you say so…"
    kura "Yeah."
    
    show kura cunning
    kura "Anyway, I should let you get back to your book."

    show utagu huh 
    utagu "Oh, this?"
    utagu "I wasn't actually going to read it right now. I'm just deciding which books I want to take out. We're only allowed five, remember?"
    show kura hmm
    kura "Oh yeah."

    show utagu smile 
    utagu "So I need to prioritize."
    show utagu uuh 
    utagu "I do think I'll take this one, though."
    show kura frown
    kura "You might need to wait a bit."

    show utagu huh 
    utagu "What do you mean?"
    show kura hmm
    kura "Well, there's nobody in there, right? How can we check out a book without a librarian?"

    show utagu frown 
    utagu "Right… I didn't see anybody when I came in, either. That's annoying."
    utagu "I wonder where they all are…"
    kura "We did just come from lunch, so I thought maybe they're all still on their lunch breaks."

    show utagu worry 
    utagu "Yeah. Maybe."
    show kura smile
    kura "Don't worry, I'll wait with you in the meantime."
    kura "In fact, whichever of these you decide not to take, I'll check out myself."

    show utagu smile
    "Utagu laughs and leans back into her chair, burying her face another book from the stack."
    utagu "Perfect."
    "I flip open the robot book, find the first sentence, and start reading."
