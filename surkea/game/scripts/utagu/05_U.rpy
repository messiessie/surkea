    "It happens just as the bell rings to mark the end of class."
    "I'm putting my books away when I hear Utagu scream."
    "It's not a drawn-out noise. It crashes against my ears rather like glass shattering. Quick and punctuated."
    "She's standing by her desk, one hand at her mouth, the other pointing to the windows."
    "They're black."
    "Empty."
    "As if there's nothing behind them at all."
    "Somehow, the inside of the classroom is still lit, like the Sun is still out there, illuminating us."
    "But it's not."
    "It's gone."
    "Oni and Kokoro are looking too."
    "Kokoro appears unfazed, blinking the sight happily away, but Oni grimaces."
    "She doesn't look surprised. Only upset."

    "Utagu chokes out the words, rooted in her spot."
    "I shake my head."

    kura "I see it, too."
    "I walk up to the windows and lean forward, peering through."
    "It isn't just dark."
    "It's completely blank. There's nothing on the other side."
    "I raise a hand and press it against the glass."
    "In a blink, it all comes back."
    "The school courtyard fills in instantly. The clouds reappear, like they were never gone, and the Sun is back, though it doesn't add to the light in the room."
    "It's like the outside and the inside are totally separate."
    show utagu cry2
    utagu "What the fuck was that?"
    "She's still standing in the same spot, pulling at her hair anxiously."
    show utagu bull
    utagu "Did you all see that?"
    utagu "It just disappeared!"
    show utagu worry2
    utagu "What the fuck?"

    show utagu bull
    utagu "This isn't weather."
    utagu "This is…"
    show utagu worry2

    kura "Utagu, take a breath."
    show utagu worry
    kura "We all noticed it, but I'm sure there's an explanation."
    show kura hmm
    kura "Oni?"
    "I call out her name not because I plan on believing her, but because she's at least presented us with explanations the last two times."
    "In fact, I'm very curious to see what she'll come up with this time."
    "Personally, I'm with Utagu."
    "But it wouldn't help to tell her that."
    "Oni sighs."

    oni "I think it's the new polarized window technology they're testing out."
    kura "Polarized windows?"
    show oni neutral_smile
    oni "It's fancier than blinds. The windows can darken from either direction with an electrical current."
    oni "They must have been messing with the controls just now. They blacked them out from our direction, but not from outside, which is why all the light still made it in."
    show oni neutral
    oni "You happened to touch the glass right when they turned it off, Kura."
    "She delivers this explanation in the most nonchalant monotone, as though it ought to be obvious."
    "It sounds suspiciously rehearsed. It fits better than her previous explanations. Almost too well."
    show kura frown
    kura "How do you know all this? Why are you always the one with the answers?"
    show oni smile
    oni "I pay attention, Kura."
    oni "It shouldn't come as a surprise."
    oni "Kokoro doesn't have a care in the world. Utagu's taken a hit to the head. You're chronically absent-minded."
    show oni neutral
    show kura hmm
    oni "I'm the grounded one of us."
    oni "They made an announcement to the school about the windows during our last monthly assembly. I assume nobody else here was paying attention."
    "I don't even remember the assembly."
    "I want to press Oni on her story, but Utagu breaks down before I can say anything."
    show utagu worry2
    utagu "But that doesn't make any sense!"
    utagu "I don't remember an assembly. I don't remember anything about polarized windows."

    show kura hmm
    utagu "{i}The only one who seems to think this is okay!{/i} That's who you are."
    show utagu frown
    utagu "Except Kokoro. But she never complains anyway."
    "Utagu tries to wipe away the tears now streaming down her face and balls her fists in frustration."
    show utagu worry
    utagu "This isn't like you, Oni."
    utagu "You're hiding something, and it scares me."
    utagu "Kura sees it too. I know she does."
    show utagu huh
    utagu "Isn't that right, Kura?"
    kura "I—well…"
    kura "I think a bunch of strange things are happening at once."
    show kura worry
    kura "But… if you think about it, that's bound to happen."
    kura "We're going to have strange days when coincidences pile up."
    show kura smile
    kura "Today is just one of those days."
    show utagu frown
    utagu "Today is just an unusually strange day? Is that really what you think."
    "It isn't."
    kura "It is."
