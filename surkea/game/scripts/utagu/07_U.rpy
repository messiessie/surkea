    kura "Utagu."
    "She doesn't respond. She only whimpers, turning on her feet to look down the first corridor, and then the second, and then the first, which comes back to face her before she's turned full circle."
    kura "Utagu!"
    "Still she just mumbles something under her breath, something unintelligible through the noise of the walls bending, creaking."
    kura "Utagu! We have to go!"
    kura "We need to find the others!"
    show utagu worry
    "At this, she stops turning and snaps her gaze to me."
    utagu "The- the others?"
    show kura worry
    kura "Yes. Oni and Kokoro. They must be where we left them. We have to find them."
    "Utagu nods and looks at the floor. It ripples at her feet like the edge of a pond. The tiles lap against her shoes and break around the soles."
    "Her eyes widen before she shuts them tight and nods once more."
    show utagu frown
    utagu "Right."
    utagu "But which way?"
    show kura hmm
    kura "Um."
    "I squint down one end of the hallway. The edges curve inward to return my stare."
    "It seems familiar, but it isn't the right way."
    "The building rotates around us so I can peer down the other end."
    kura "This way, I think."
    show utagu huh
    utagu "You think?"
    kura "Unless... no. It's this way."
    "Utagu makes a noise that sounds halfway between assent and fear, and we set off."
    "It only takes two steps."
    "A chunk of the path in front of us disappears. The hall gives way to a black void, cleanly cut into it, and resumes a few metres later."
    kura "What...?"
    "The void is replaced by a door, obscuring the way behind it."
    "Wordlessly, I run ahead and open it as Utagu follows, in tears."
    "I open the door."
    "Three doors clatter to the ground behind us and the floor beneath them breaks away into an abyss."

    "The wrong corridor greets us through the empty door frame, creaking inward as though threatening to collapse on top of us, but there's nothing left for us to retreat to."
    show utagu cry
    "Utagu raises her hands to her temples, eyes wide."
    utagu "What is this?!"
    kura "I don't know. Just come on!"
    "With no other choice, I grab her by the arm and pull her through."
    "We traverse the length of the hall in fewer steps than should have been possible. It splits in two paths."
    kura "This isn't right..."
    show utagu cry2
    utagu "Kura..."
    "She's pointing to our right, finger trembling. I follow it and see the corridor disappear again."
    "At what should be the end of the corridor there's a door frame, and through it I see us, Utagu pointing and me staring back at myself."
    "Utagu falls to her knees. The ceiling follows her, the space constricting us with a groan."
    "I push up against it and try to lift Utagu back up."
    kura "Utagu, we can't stop! We have to keep going!"
    "She pulls her arm from my grasp and buries her head in her hands."
    show utagu worry2
    utagu "No... don't you see?"
    show kura frown
    kura "See what? That something's wrong and we have to go?"
    show utagu worry
    utagu "Nothing's wrong. This is exactly how it's supposed to be."
    "A few tears drip through her fingers and burn through the floor. I feel a pressure mounting from every direction."
    kura "Utagu, what are you talking about?"
    ##music surkea test 2-1
    utagu "Don't you remember, Kura?"
    "She lifts her head. It looks wrong. Swollen and ajar. Cracked, like a window, and flowing, like a dune."
    "She lifts her head. Her eyes look through me and don't seem to see. The pressure builds, and I find it hard to breathe."
    show utagu huh
    utagu "This is how it always was."
    utagu "Every time. This is how it ends."
    kura "I don't... what?"
    show utagu smile
    "She smiles, only it's a broken smile. Her lips drag on in the wrong directions and her eyes crack at the edges. I can feel my limbs being squeezed. It hurts."
    show utagu worry
    utagu "I was right all along. I was right to be afraid."
    show utagu worry2
    utagu "There is no happy end to this."
    kura "Utagu, no... please. Don't say that."
    show utagu bull
    utagu "But why not? It's true. You know it's true."
    "Somewhere in an unmapped crevasse of my mind, a distant sound of agreement makes itself known."
    "I don't understand this, and I don't remember, but I remember remembering. I remember an emotion."
    "The endless unease breaking to discomfort and pain and an overwhelming feeling of helplessness."
    "Utagu stands up. Rather, she was always standing. Didn't she fall?"
    show utagu smile
    "She smiles again, and the wall behind her shatters. The ceiling collapses and gives way to black."
    "Standing on a mere patch of floor suspended in a black void, my chest tightens with the force of a train."
    show utagu uuh
    utagu "We've been here a thousand times. We'll be here a thousand more."
    utagu "I always feel it coming. I never know why."
    ##scene CG U2_1
    "She looks at her bandaged arm. The void around us booms with a discordant harmony."
    utagu "I know what this is."
    "I struggle to answer her as an incorporeal weight pushes me to my knees."
    kura "It's- it's from when you fell off your bike, isn't it?"
    utagu "There never was a bike."
    "She reaches for the loose ends of the medical tape."
    "Something in me screams in apprehension."
    kura "U-Utagu, no! Don't touch it!"
    "Her lips spill further to the side. Is it a sneer, now?"
    utagu "But why not? This is me."
    "I fall on my side as my knees buckle. The noise engulfing us penetrates my bones and I feel it inside me."
    "Immobile, I can only watch as Utagu unravels the tape."
    "One layer, and another, and another."
    "All the while, her body contorts, expands in all the wrong directions, bubbling as it never should."
    "The cacophonous groaning of the abyss around us punctuates the last turn, and her bandages fall through the ground."
    "I can feel my eyes being pressed from their sockets as I watch Utagu."
    "She isn't smiling anymore."
    ##scene CG U2_2
    utagu "This is it."
    "I see her bloat into something incomprehensible."
    "Her arm balloons, and a mouth sprouts where her hand was, drooling and moaning in feral hunger."
    "Her legs thicken and fuse together, another mouth spawning on the surface with a cry of anguish."
    "Her head's pushed aside by a smaller, cancerous mound that squints at me."
    kura "Utagu, no..."
    "The little ground beneath us begins to give way to black and I see Utagu's misshapen form disintegrating."
    kura "No..."
    utagu "Goodbye, Kura."

    "She's gone, and so is everything else. I see only oblivion in every direction."
    "But three final words make it to my ears before the last of my senses disappear."
    utagu "Until next time."
