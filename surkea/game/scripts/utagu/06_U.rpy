    utagu "Yeah. Like I'm somewhere I'm not supposed to be. Or, I'm something I was never meant to be."
    utagu "I feel like I don't fit together."

    show kura hmm

    show kura smile
    kura "But this is just another day. Another day at school. And tomorrow, another one will come. A better one."
    "Utagu doesn't meet my eye, but fixates on a spot on the floor, her voice tremulous."

    utagu "And what if it doesn't?"
    "I don't know what to say to this. But Kokoro speaks up to say it for me."

    kokoro "If you expect tomorrow to be bad, of course it will be."
    show kura smile
    kokoro "You can't spend your whole life worrying that things will get worse."
    "Utagu mumbles something in response, too quiet for Kokoro's ears, but just loud enough for mine."
    show utagu worry
    utagu "But what if I can?"
    "The moment passes uneasily. It seems like the clock on the wall ticks thrice for each second."
    "It must be the tension in the air."
    "Finally, Oni breaks the silence."

    oni "It isn't worth worrying."
    show oni frown
    oni "You can spend every second in anxiety. The best that gives you is a sick satisfaction the one time you're right."
    show oni neutral_smile
    oni "The rest of the time, you're just going to be constantly worried for no reason. It's not worth it."
    "Utagu glances up at her and gives a weak nod."
    "She blinks, as though to clear her thoughts for a second."
    show utagu uuh
    utagu "Yeah..."
    utagu "You're probably right."

    "Apparently statisfied at this resolution, Kokoro withdraws to a nearby desk and starts fidgeting with the hem of her skirt."
    "Oni stays put, watching us with an unreadable expression."
    "I decide I should offer Utagu a few more words of comfort."
    "As I step closer, though, several things happen. They unfold slowly, yet happen all in the same instant."
    show utagu huh
    "First, Utagu's eyes widen and her mouth drops. She points at the ground."
    "And then I look, too, and find myself staring into a widening gap in the floor, right at Utagu's feet."
    show kura frown
    "Except that there's nothing behind this gap. No concrete or plumbing or foundation. Just an endless black."
    "I watch, immobilized, as pieces of the floor crumble at the edges and the hole grows larger."
    "Before I can offer the slightest reaction, it's beneath both of us."
    "I have a moment to look up and catch Oni's mesmerized, horrified gaze, fixed on us."
    "Then, I feel myself falling, though into what I can't see."

    kura "The basement...?"
    "It was. There was no mistaking the distinctive colour of the walls and the musty scent of the place."

    "I look to Utagu. She's frozen in place, mouth agape and brow contorted to an expression of horror."
