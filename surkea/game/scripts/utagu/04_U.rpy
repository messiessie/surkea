    "Lunch comes and goes more quickly than yesterday. We eat in silence, each lost in our own thoughts."
    "I imagine Kokoro is thinking mostly about food."
    "But I can tell Utagu is still confused about her bandaged arm. Perplexed that she can't remember anything about the apparent accident."
    "She didn't pursue it at the time like I did, when Oni offered her explanation."
    "But she still sits with a worried expression, her brow heavily creased and her eyes intense with thought."
    "As I sit next to her, I can't get the subject out of my head either. Something about it just feels wrong."
    "And Oni, across from me, doesn't take her eyes off the two of us."
    "Her look isn't exactly confrontational. It's more like she wants to make sure we don't go anywhere."
    "Like she thinks we might disappear at any moment."
    "It's sort-of sweet, but also disconcerting."
    "Oni must want us not to worry, with the way she's been explaining things. Whether she believes it or not, she wants us to think that nothing's wrong."
    "But she looks worried herself. And that's not reassuring."
    "Something's off, even if she'd rather we didn't know."
    "I can only hope it's nothing serious."
    "Presently, Utagu gets my attention with a poke at my shoulder."

        yanchor 1.0 ypos 1080+300 xalign -0.1
    kura "Hm? What's up?"
    
    show utagu uuh
    utagu "Can you help me with this one?"
    "She slides her notebook toward me, indicating a set of equations at the bottom of the page."
    show kura smile
    kura "Oh, sure."
    kura "It's like this, look: if you multiply the one on top by three, you can add it to the one on the bottom."
    kura "And you get an easier equation to work with."
    "Utagu makes a noise of comprehension."
    show utagu smile
    utagu "Oh, I get it. That makes sense."
    "She pulls the notebook back and resumes her scribbles at the bottom, working through the last few steps."
    "I watch her, smiling. Her focused expression is endearing."
    "In a moment, she gets to the answer and underlines it twice, then flips the notebook closed."
    show utagu frown
    "She pauses, frowning at the cover."
    "It's like she completely lost her train of thought."
    show utagu worry
    utagu "Kura…"
    show kura hmm
    kura "Yeah?"
    show utagu huh
    utagu "Who marks these?"
    kura "What?"
    utagu "Who grades our homework?"
    show kura worry
    kura "Um. The teacher?"
    "She turns to look at me."
    show utagu frown
    utagu "Who's the teacher?"
    kura "What do you mean? The teacher is our teacher. The one we have homeroom with."
    utagu "Kura. Can you tell me who it is we have homeroom with?"
    kura "Of course, it's…"
    show kura hmm
    "I…"
    "What the hell?"
    "I can't."
    "I don't know who our homeroom teacher is."
    "I don't have a name. A face. A voice. Anything."
    "I'm drawing just a blank."
    show utagu uuh
    utagu "You don't remember either, do you?"
    kura "No… I don't."
    kura "Now that I think about it, she's been away for a while, hasn't she?"
    kura "We've been left to do our work by ourselves the past bit."
    kura "So it's natural to forget."
    show kura smile
    kura "We'll remember as soon as she comes back, I'm sure."
    show utagu worry
    utagu "Do you really believe that?"
    "I'm not sure that I do. But I'm not sure I have much of a choice, either."
    show kura worry
    kura "It's the best explanation, right?"
    kura "Nothing else would make sense."
    show utagu huh
    utagu "You're right, it wouldn't."
    show kura smile
    kura "So it has to be that."
    show utagu frown
    utagu "If you say so."
    
    show oni neutral:
        yanchor 1.0 ypos 1080+300 xalign 1.2    
    oni "It is."
    "Once again, Oni's speaking up to address Utagu's probing."
    show oni smile
    oni "Our teacher was Miyagawa. Tall, brown hair."
    show kura hmm
    kura "Was?"
    show oni neutral_smile
    oni "Yeah. She went on leave a couple weeks ago, but left us a curriculum to go by until they find a replacement."
    show utagu huh
    utagu "Shouldn't there be a substitute?"
    show oni neutral
    oni "Usually there would be, but teachers are spread pretty thin on the market these days."
    oni "The school couldn't find anyone in time, so here we are. Hanging out on our own."
    show utagu uuh
    utagu "Hm."
    "As Oni speaks, I feel a faint memory materializing. It's distant, but there."
    kura "I think I remember who you're talking about."
    show utagu frown
    utagu "You do?"
    kura "Yeah."
    kura "She must have been really dull to leave so weak an impression on me."
    
    show oni smile
    oni "She was. I'm not surprised you can hardly remember her."
    show utagu worry
    utagu "I can't remember her at all."
    show oni neutral
    oni "Same answer."
    utagu "Well…"
    "An uncomfortable silence fills the next few seconds as Utagu fiddles with the spiral spine of her notebook."
    show utagu frown
    utagu "Okay. Tell me this, then."
    utagu "Who are our classmates?"
    kura "What?"
    show kura worry
    kura "Oni and Kokoro, right here, obviously."
    show utagu frown
    utagu "Just them?"
    show oni smile
    show kura hmm
    oni "What, are we not enough for you?"
    show utagu worry
    utagu "No—that's not what I meant."
    utagu "I mean, isn't this weird? Four of us to a class?"
    utagu "Just look at the way our desks are set up. Who arranges a classroom like this? It's like nobody else is ever here."
    show oni neutral
    oni "That's because nobody else ever {i}is{/i} here."
    show utagu huh
    utagu "What?"
    oni "They put us four in here together for the streamlined curriculum."
    kura "The streamlined curriculum?"
    oni "It's what they give you if you score high on the entrance exams."
    show utagu uuh
    utagu "And only us four scored high enough for that?"
    show oni smile
    oni "From our year, yes."
    oni "So it's just us in this homeroom. That's why the desks are pushed together like this. It's why we don't have any other classmates."
    show oni frown
    oni "Does that answer your question, Utagu?"
    show utagu worry
    utagu "I suppose."
    show utagu frown
    utagu "But what about other students? In other classes here?"
    utagu "Why is nobody ever around?"
    show oni neutral
    oni "They are. I just told you about Mei, didn't I?"
    oni "You're probably still a bit dazed from falling, I think. You might have gotten a concussion."
    "But Utagu's right. I'm brought back to the realization that I remember nothing of her accident, and have no recollection of Mei."
    "In fact, I'm not sure I remember seeing any other students at all."
    "The most I can conjure from my memories are empty silhouettes traversing the halls."
    "I don't know if they're real. They could just as likely be my imagination."
    "And yet, I don't have any other explanation for this."
    "Oni's answers are the best I have to go on. They make at least a little sense."
    show utagu worry
    utagu "I don't know…"
    show utagu huh
    utagu "What do you think, Kura?"
    "I think something's very strange, but I don't think it's worth Utagu's anxieties."
    "I'll have to tread carefully here."
    show kura worry
    kura "I think what Oni's saying makes sense."
    kura "Your accident is just really not helping with your memory, which is why everything seems strange."
    "She raises an eyebrow, but doesn't protest."
    show utagu uuh
    utagu "If you say so."
    show kura smile
    kura "Yeah."
    "Even as I say so, I bite my lip, uncertain."
