    kokoro smile_open "Uh-huh!"
    "She beams at me."
    kokoro "Wanna help?"
    kura smile "Sure thing."
    kokoro grin "Yay!"
    "She springs from her chair, grabbing me by the wrist and all but dragging me out of the room."

    kokoro smile "I was hoping you'd help."
    "We continue to weave through the hallways at a breakneck pace."
    "I narrowly miss an open door as I try to keep up with Kokoro."
    "In almost no time at all, we're standing outside the cooking classrooms."
    "Kokoro grins at me before throwing the door open and rushing inside."
    "I follow at a much more reasonable speed."

    kura "Okay, so I guess you check that side and I'll look over here."
    kokoro grin "Great!"
    "Kokoro launches into her search with gusto, throwing pans, cups and other miscellaneous items out of the way."
    "I hope she knows she'll have to clean that up."
    kura hmm "So what's the dish you want to learn about?"
    kokoro "I uhh, I'm not sure what it's called."
    "She giggles sheepishly."
    kura "Was it savoury or sweet?"
    kokoro smile "Sweet! Definitely sweet."
    "She nods, as if to confirm it to herself."
    "At least I can discard some of these dinner cookbooks."
    kokoro smile_open "Oh, it came in a bowl, too!"
    "She exclaims as if she'd just solved a tough math question or something."
    kura "You can serve anything in a bowl if you want to."
    "Kokoro opens her mouth to respond but nothing comes out."
    kokoro "I guess you're right..."

    "After half an hour of searching we've narrowed the search down to seven books."
    kura cunning "Now we just have to read through here and see if we find it."
    kokoro worry "That's a lot of reading..."
    kura smile "We don't have to read the whole thing. Maybe just look at the pictures and see if you recognise it."
    show kokoro smile
    "Kokoro's gloom lifts slightly as we get stuck into the cookbooks. but before long we grow bored of the silence and start a conversation."
    kokoro "So I'm watching this TV show at the moment."
    kura hmm "That's a surprise."
    "She frowns at my mocking tone."
    kokoro grin "Hey, I have a life you know! So anyway, so there's this guy, and he works this awful desk job."
    kokoro smile "His boss is rude, his coworkers hate him, all the classic stuff."
    kura "Classic?"
    kokoro neutral "You know what I mean. So he decides to quit his job and fulfill his dream of becoming an artist."
    kokoro "Then the whole show is about him trying to make it big as a painter or whatever."
    kura "Sounds pretty standard."
    kokoro smile_open "But then the twist is that the whole thing was in his imagination!"
    kokoro "Turns out he's just sat at his desk, daydreaming."
    kokoro smile "Crazy, right?!"
    "She studies my face for a reaction."
    kura frown "It would have been exciting if you hadn't just spoiled it for me."

    "I giggle. No point in watching it now anyway."
