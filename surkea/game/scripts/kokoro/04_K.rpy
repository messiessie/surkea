    "Later that day, I head to lunch with Kokoro."
    "Maybe it shouldn't be, but the mug... thing from earlier is still on my mind."
    "‘mug thing’ is about all I can think of to describe it. What else would work? The mug... anomaly?"
    "Kokoro's probably right. I was tired. Maybe it was a trick of the light or something, a weird reflection."
    "Nothing to worry about."
    "I don't realise right away that we've already sat down to eat, and Kokoro has started speaking."
    kokoro "- so I wasn't sure if I'd brought my lunch today or not and I was thinking about it all lesson until I got a chance to look in my bag."
    "Luckily, the topic of conversation isn't so complex that I can't cotton on pretty quickly."
    kura "Why did you think you'd forgotten it?"
    kokoro frown "I'm not sure, I just had a hunch. A hunch about my lunch!"
    kura "Well... had you?"
    kokoro smileopen "Uh, Kura, you dummy, what do you think I'm eating right now?"
    "I look down. Sure enough, there's a box of food in front of Kokoro and she's munching away."
    show kokoro neutral
    "How did I not notice that before? It's like it was just outside of my peripheral vision or something, but it was right in front of me."
    "Man, how sleep-deprived am I?"
    "I don't have much time to dwell on this before we're joined by someone else."

    "Utagu joins us, swiftly sitting down next to Kokoro."
    kokoro smile "Hey Utagu!"
    utagu huh "Oh, hey."
    kokoro "Where've ya been?"
    utagu "Oh, uh, just went to the library to hand something in."
    "I eye her up, curiously."
    kura "Is everything okay?"
    utagu smile "Yeah! Of course, I just, eh- "
    utagu frown "Yeah, it's fine."
    "It sure doesn't look fine."
    "I don't get the chance to dig further, though - Kokoro's on it."
    kokoro grin "Come on Utagu, don't be silly! What's up?"
    "She looks a little put-out by Kokoro's needling, but relents."
    utagu huh "I couldn't find it."
    show kokoro worry
    kura "What, the book you wanted to hand in?"
    utagu worry "No - the library."
    "Kokoro is clearly tickled by this."
    kokoro laugh "What?! But you're there all the time! How could you forget where it is??"
    utagu bull "I didn't forget where it was!"
    "Utagu looks kind of confused, as though she doesn't know what happened."
    utagu "I just couldn't find it."
    kokoro frown "...What's the difference?"
    utagu "I went to wear it normally is - I think, anyway - and it just... wasn't."
    kura "It was closed?"
    utagu "No!"
    "The confusion what she's trying to get across is causing her expresses itself in raised tones."
    utagu "It wasn't there. The doors, and the sign outside... I couldn't even see it on the map."
    "I reach into my bag, brow deeply furrowed, and pull out my school planner."
    "Flipping to the back page, I check it briefly, then slap it down on the table."
    kura "The phantom library returns."
    "Utagu looks down at the map, studying it carefully."
    show utagu worry
    "Then, she pulls out her own planner, placing it next to mine on the last page, her eyes flicking between the two."
    utagu "...It's back. Okay, the library's back. That's fine."
    utagu worry2 "But I swear it was gone! I wasn't being stupid or blind, I swear!"
    utagu "I walked up and down that corridor for 10 minutes thinking I must have walked too far somehow, it wasn't there!"
    kokoro smile "Shhh, Utagu, shhhhhh, it's okay."
    "Kokoro pats an increasingly frantic Utagu on the sholder."
    kokoro "Maybe you {i}and{/i} Kura are having an off day."
    kura "Kokoro, come on."
    show kokoro frown
    "I realise I'd raised my voice a little."
    kura "Sorry, I didn't mean to snap."
    kura "It just seems a little weird, doesn't it?"
    kura "I mean, the mug was on thing, but this is an entire room."
    kura "Entire rooms can't go missing."
    "Silence falls between us, tense and heavy with worry."
    "Utagu looks between Kokoro and I, concerned."
    utagu frown "I shouldn't have said anything, it was stupid."
    kokoro neutral "Don't beat yourself up like that, it wasn't stupid. I don't know if I'd mind if a library disappeared forever, but I'd be worried too if it happened unexpectedly!"
    kura "Yeah... me too."
    kura "I think..."
    "What do I think?"
    kura "...We should just forget about it. Right?"
    "Utagu blurts out."
    utagu worry "Can we just go and check?"

    show kokoro neutral
    utagu "Okay... the library is definitely back."
    utagu smile "Nothing to worry about."
    kura "Right."
    kokoro smile "Right!"
    kokoro "It's all good, isn't it guys?"
    kura "I guess so."
    utagu huh "Yeah."
    "We stare at the library door for a few seconds, as thought none of us wants to look away for fear it might disappear if we don't keep an eye on it."
    kura "Let's just go."
