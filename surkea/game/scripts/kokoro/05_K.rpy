    "The incident with the library keeps tugging at the corners of my mind."
    "Why did it vanish like that?"
    "We didn't get lost, either. Utagu and I have been to the library plenty of times to know where it is."
    "Kokoro seems unphased by the bizarreness of it all, instead preferring to chat with us about our homework or a TV show she's watching."
    kokoro "You know, if you keep that up, your face will stay that way."
    "I roll my eyes."
    kura frown "Ha. Ha. Ha. You're such a kidder."
    kokoro "It's true! My mother would... say that."
    "She pauses."
    kokoro frown "My... mother?"
    kura hmm "What about your mom?"
    kokoro smile "...Nevermind! I think I just remembered that wrong."
    "That's unusual. Kokoro never talked about her mom before."
    kura "Was it another family member?"
    kokoro neutral "Maybe? Probably?"

    utagu "What did everyone bring today?"
    kura "You know what I made, just the usual for everyone."
    "I hand over my usual box of karaage over to Utagu."
    kura "And for you, Kokoro..."
    "I reach for the second box with her favorite rice balls."
    kokoro smile "Kura, you always know..."
    kokoro "..."
    kura hmm "What?"
    "Kokoro gives a strange look at her bento box. Curious, I take a look too."

    "The rice balls I put so much effort into are gone, replaced with a gelatanous green and purple mass."
    kokoro grin "Haha, is this a prank? Did you put food coloring in the rice cooker, Kura?"
    kura frown "N-no, Kokoro, I..."
    kokoro "Oh well, it doesn't matter! Rice balls are rice balls!"
    "She takes a huge chomp out of the 'rice ball'. Juices squirt out of where her teeth bit the surface, oozing black sludge."
    utagu cry "Kokoro! What are you eating? That's not rice!"
    "Kokoro finishes chewing and swallows."
    kokoro grin2 "Of course it is, dummy! I wouldn't eat it if it wasn't."
    "I can see her mouth, blackened with whatever was in that thing she just ate."
    kura frown "Excuse me. I have to... go."

    oni "Kura, did something happen? Tell me."

    kura hmm "Something strange happened to the rice balls I made for Kokoro."
    oni shock "What do you mean by that?"
    "That's a new expression for her."
    kura "I don't know, the rice balls weren't rice balls. They were some kind of blob thing in the shape of a rice ball."
    kokoro "I'm telling you guys, it was just food coloring!"
    utagu "No. Whatever that was, it wasn't any kind of food."
    "Utagu acting as my eyewitness makes me more sure than ever."
    kokoro "Oni, have you noticed anything odd at this school recently?"
    oni neutral "I'm... not sure I follow."
    "Yesterday, it was Kokroro's mug and the library. This can't be coincidence."
    "Something's up with this school."

    oni neutral "I..."

    "She points a shaking finger outdoors."
    "There's nothing there. Just a meadow and a few trees in the distance."

    oni neutral_smile "Yes... it's a property of the glass this school uses."
    oni "You have nothing to worry about, girls."
    kokoro laugh "R-right! Yeah!"
    "Kokoro saw something that shouldn't be possible. There's only one Kokoro, and those windows never did anything special... until recently."
    "Even with Oni's excuse, Kokoro still looks rattled."
    "What did she see out there?"
