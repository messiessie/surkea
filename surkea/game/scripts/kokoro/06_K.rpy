    "It’s too heavy to indicate any form of relaxing."
    "She’s been sitting with her face glued to the windows. What is she focusing so hard on outside?"
    "All us other girls can just see vague blurs of a dense forest. It’s too far off to see anything, and the thick rain doesn’t help."

    oni "…"
    "Oni sighs and puts away her book. She was the only one trying to distract herself from the uncomfortable mood radiating from Kokoro."
    "Utagu and I on the other hand were too worried to focus on anything other than Kokoro."
    "So much so that we almost missed the blackout that happened outside the windows."
    "The only reason I noticed was because Kokoro was the one who flinched just as it happened."
    "However, she doesn’t say a word. Doesn’t let out a single breath."
    "She stops her heavy breathing."
    oni angry "See? It happened again. I swear, those technicians never fix those things."
    kura "What in the world are you referring to, Oni?"
    oni neutral "You saw what just happened? That’s a new thing I heard the school wanted to try out. The windows can block out any source of light in a flash, so students aren’t so easily distracted by the outside."
    kura "Wow…"
    "Oni makes a face that says 'Right?' as she looks at me."
    kura mad "…That’s probably the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard as an excuse."
    "I stand up and walk to a still frozen Kokoro. She looks even more tense the second I touch her shoulder."
    "She turns to look slightly at my general direction."
    kura neutral "Kokoro, I know you aren’t alright. You aren’t handling things well. None of us are, but you shouldn’t freeze up and keep your anxiety to yourself."
    "She finally takes a deep breath."
    kura smile "We’re in this together. Let’s help each other out."
    kokoro "…"
    "She turns to face me."
    #kokoro sprite on same level as kura
    kokoro "…Okej."
    utagu worry "Huh?"
    "Kokoro’s accent sounds… Odd."
    kura "Did you swallow a frog?"
    kokoro shock "Det… Tror jag inte?"
    "…I have no idea what words she just said."
    kokoro frown "I och för sig, den maten du lagade igår gav mig kramp… Men jag mår bättre nu!"
    "We all stare blankly at Kokoro. Not one of us know how to reply to that."
    "Oni casts a suspicious look while me and Utagu look shocked."
    kura "Kokoro, not a single word of what you just said was anything I understand. When did you learn this?"
    kokoro "Ursäkta? Kura, jag pratar med dig precis som vanligt. Har du-"
    utagu worry2 "No, no, no! Kokoro stop! We don’t understand what you’re saying!"
    kokoro shock "..?!"
    "Kokoro looks at us like we’re suddenly aliens."
    #as soon as the next line starts, some sort of sound effect plays that rises in volume, then cuts everything to black and silence after about 2 seconds, even if her sentence isn’t finished before it blacks out (think how it’s done in Echo https://youtu.be/-v1dV_R39lk?t=43m48s )
    kokoro "Seriöst? Ska ni hålla på med ännu mer skit? Som om det omkring mig inte är nog?"
    #after cut to black, BG and all sprites but Kokoro fade in
    "The lights abruptly cut out, as does Kokoro's voice."
    kura "What the hell just happened?"
    "Was there just a blackout in... here?!"
    "Utagu shrieks, horrified by what just happened."
    show oni shock
    "Oni doesn’t move. She looks lost in her own thoughts."
    "Did she know about this too?"
    kura "So what’s the explanation for this then, Oni? Some dumb experiment the principal wants to pull on us?"
    "I get no answer. All I hear is Utagu’s crying."
    utagu cry2 "She’s gone! Where is she?! Where’s Kokoro?!"
    "Wait-"
    "I turn around to scan the classroom."
    "Kokoro just...Vanished."
    "I run over to Utagu and hold her trembling body in my arms."
    "This is going too far."
    kura "Oni, if I hear any more of your bullshit excuses you won’t be able to take a step outside of this classroom."
    "Oni barely reacts. She doesn’t seem very threatened by me."
    "But as she opens her mouth to speak, she’s cut off by another blackout."

    "Utagu is no longer in my arms. Both her and Oni are gone."
    "What is going on?!"
    "I launch myself up from the floor about to run out of the room, but something on my desk stops me."
    "It’s a note written by... Oni?"

    " ‘We’re off looking for Kokoro. Stay here.’ "
    "Like hell I will!"

    show kura mad
    "I have to try and look for Kokoro. I don’t believe for a second that the others would just leave me like this."
    "I start running through the hallways, kicking up every door I see to check if she’s in one of them."
    "Things feel uncomfortable in school. The darkness almost has a grip on me with its cold hands, dragging me back wherever I go."
    "But I don’t stop."
    "I won’t give up until I find Kokoro!"
    show kura frown
    #fade to black and back to the same BG
    "Nothing. Not a single trace. Absolutely no trace of her."
    "I have no idea where she could be. What if she’s been wandering around this whole time?"
    "Did she leave school and go somewhere else?"
    "...Can she leave? Can any of us?"
    show kura hmm
    "Then I remember. The first place she left might be the last one she went to."
    "Maybe she’s been behind me all this time."
    "I turn around and run as fast as I can to our classroom."
    "I notice that the door is closed now. I KNOW I left it open."
    "Without thinking I throw the door open."
