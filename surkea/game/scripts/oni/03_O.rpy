    "...What..."
    "How did I end up here?"
    "I’m lying face down on a cold floor. I can’t see anything."
    "I try to move, but my body is too weak."
    "I manage to move my right arm, then my left."
    "I push myself up and look around."
    #bg dark classroom in
    "I’m in... school?"
    "Why am I still here?"
    "It’s late. Only thing I can see outside the windows is darkness."
    "How long have I been here? More importantly, WHY am I here?"
    "There must be someone around. I can't have been able to stay here so late without someone noticing."
    #bg dark hallway
    "It’s dead silent just outside the classroom."
    "The darkness has consumed the whole school, and not just because it’s night. There's something {i}more{/i} about this."
    "I can’t describe it. I just feel it."
    "As I absorb my surroundings, something horrifying appears in front of me."
    #same BG but with added blob creature thing
    "There is some indescribable mass in the hallway."
    "It has form, but it's far from human, and not like any animal I've ever seen. It's hard to see in the darkness, yet I doubt I'd be able to make any more sense of it in the light."
    "And it has movement. This is not some immobile blog of gunk. This hideous thing is breathing."
    "Looking at it sends a shiver up by spine. What the hell is it?"
    "Is this a joke? Did Kokoro attempt to make squid ink bread?"
    #zoom onto the creature
    "It’s moving towards me."
    "It doesn’t have any legs or proper arms, yet there's something eerily human about its movements"
    "What does it want? How can it know I am actually in front of it?"
    "Is it dangerous?"
    #add Oni to frame
    "I have to get away. I have to wake up from this."
    "I can’t stay in this dream any longer."
    #zoom out, showing more of Oni
    "...What is she doing?"
    "Oni appears from nowhere and steps between me and the creature."
    "She doesn’t say a word. All she does is look at me."
    "I know she’s given me that look before, but when?"
    "Before I come to any conclusion, something pulls me back with great force."
    "The last thing I see is Oni reaching out for me."
